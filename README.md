This project open-sources the complete implementation of the PDNS-DODE algorithm proposed in the paper "PDNS-DODE: A Discrete Osprey Optimization and Differential Evolution Algorithm with PageRank Diffusion Neighborhood Search for Influence Maximization in Social Networks". It includes the core algorithm code and seven real-world social network datasets, which can be directly used for algorithm verification, performance comparison, and secondary development.
