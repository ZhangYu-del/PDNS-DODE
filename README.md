We propose a discrete osprey optimization and differential evolution algorithm combined with PageRank diffusion neighborhood search for influence maximization in social networks. Seven real-world social network datasets are used in this study, including Email-Eu, Blog, Wiki-Vote, NetHEHT, CA-AstroPh, CA-HepTh, and Brightkite. These datasets are sourced from two websites: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ and https://www.arxiv.org/. The core framework of the algorithm is also provided in the PDNS-DODE.py file.
